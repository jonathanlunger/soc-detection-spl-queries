# Web Attack Tool Identification (WPScan)

## SPL Query
```spl
index=task6
| search "10.10.243.134"
| table _time uri method useragent _raw
| sort 0 _time


Purpose

This query isolates web log activity originating from 10.10.243.134. Because the dataset did not extract the source IP as a structured field, a raw text search was used. Reviewing the user-agent field revealed the requests were generated by WPScan. Chronological review of the events confirmed automated brute force activity targeting the WordPress login endpoint.






KQL (Microsoft Sentinel – Equivalent Detection Logic)
WebLogs
| where Message has "10.10.243.134"
| project TimeGenerated, uri, method, useragent, Message
| order by TimeGenerated asc
What Changed (SPL → KQL)

index=task6 becomes selecting a table in KQL (example: WebLogs).

search "IP" becomes where Message has "IP" since the IP was not a structured field.

table in SPL becomes project in KQL to select columns.

_time becomes TimeGenerated in KQL.

sort 0 _time becomes order by TimeGenerated asc.
