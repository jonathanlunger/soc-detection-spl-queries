# Web Attack Tool Identification (WPScan)

## SPL Query
```spl
index=task6
| search "10.10.243.134"
| table _time uri method useragent _raw
| sort 0 _time


Purpose

This query isolates web log activity originating from 10.10.243.134. Because the dataset did not extract the source IP as a structured field, a raw text search was used. Reviewing the user-agent field revealed the requests were generated by WPScan. Chronological review of the events confirmed automated brute force activity targeting the WordPress login endpoint.
